### Welcome to TradeTrackFolio, my 2020 NYC Tech Talent Pipeline Stage 2 Assessment!

To Use this codebase fully, there are A few steps to setting up:

1. "npm i" while in the workspace directory.
2. Head over to https://iexcloud.io/ and sign up to get your api keys.
3. Make a file in the root of the directory called secrets.js and type process.env.IEX_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY = "your-test-public-key-here"
4. Now, go into your user root directory and open your bash config file, sometimes listed as .bashrc or .bash_profile. We have to export our environment variable here to make it accessible by node. Go to the bottom of the file and type export IEX_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY = "your-test-public-key-here".

 5.Run in development mode by typing "npm run dev" while in the root of the workspace.
